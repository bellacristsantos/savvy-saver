## :bulb: Development Process
<br />

SavvySaver is a learning platform with the goal of making financial knowledge available for beginners. The platform features a time travel feature that enables users to see how much they could earn if they had invested a specific amount on a chosen date and company. It also includes functionalities such as details about investment options and a "Learn More" section that allows users to explore a list of podcasts and be redirected to listen and learn more about investments.

The team used Trello and Gitflow to ensure that each member was working on one feature, avoiding merge conflicts, and delivering high-quality code in a reasonable amount of time.

My role in this project was related to UX/UI Design, contributing to frontend development using React and Vanilla CSS, making the application responsive, and developing the "Learn More" section using GraphQL and Apollo to connect with the podcast API.
